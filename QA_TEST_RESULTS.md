- **TypeScript**: All errors resolved
- **Development Server**: Running on port 5173

## 1. End-to-End QA Pass ✅

### 1.1 Add Realistic Wine → See Suggestions → Apply → Drink Window + Scores

**Test Steps:**
1. Click "Add Bottle" button
2. Fill in wine details:
   - Producer: "Domaine de la Côte"
   - Vintage: 2019
   - Wine Name: "Les Pierres"
   - Region: "Santa Rita Hills"
   - Country Code: "US"
   - US State: "CA"
3. Submit form
4. Verify wine appears in grid
5. Click on wine card to open detail drawer
6. Verify AI suggestions panel appears (if enrichment successful)
7. Click "Apply" to apply suggestions
8. Verify drink window and scores are populated in correct sections

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Wine added successfully
- ✅ AI enrichment triggered (fire-and-forget)
- ✅ Suggestions panel shows with confidence badge
- ✅ Apply button updates wine with drink window and scores
- ✅ Data appears in correct sections (Ratings & Notes, Critic Scores)

### 1.2 Mark Drunk Functionality

**Test Steps:**
1. Find a wine with "Cellared" status
2. Click "Mark Drunk" button on wine card
3. Verify wine status changes to "Drunk"
4. Verify date is set to today
5. Verify card badge updates
6. Open wine detail drawer
7. Verify "Drank On" field shows today's date

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Status changes from "Cellared" to "Drunk"
- ✅ `drank_on` field set to current date
- ✅ Card UI updates to show "Drunk" status
- ✅ Optimistic update with rollback on error

### 1.3 Search and Filter Functionality

**Test Steps:**
1. Search by producer: "Domaine"
2. Filter by year: 2019-2020
3. Filter by region: "Bordeaux"
4. Filter by status: "Cellared"
5. Test sort options: Vintage, Rating, etc.
6. Clear filters

**Expected Results:**
- ✅ Search works across producer, wine name, appellation, region
- ✅ Year filters work with min/max range
- ✅ Region filter uses case-insensitive partial matching
- ✅ Status filter works correctly
- ✅ Sort options work as expected
- ✅ Clear filters resets all filters

## 2. Accessibility (A11y) ✅

### 2.1 Modal/Drawer Accessibility

**Verified Features:**
- ✅ **ARIA Labels**: All modals have `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby`
- ✅ **Focus Trap**: Radix UI Dialog provides automatic focus trapping
- ✅ **Escape Key**: Escape closes modals (Radix UI default)
- ✅ **Background Scroll Lock**: Background scrolling locked when modal open
- ✅ **Screen Reader Support**: Proper `DialogTitle` and `DialogDescription`
- ✅ **Close Button**: Accessible close button with screen reader text

**Implementation Details:**
- Uses Radix UI Dialog primitive for accessibility
- `WineDetailDrawer`: Has `aria-describedby={descriptionId}` with descriptive text
- `WineSheet`: Has `aria-describedby="wine-sheet-description"` with form description
- Focus management handled automatically by Radix UI

## 3. Build & Deploy ✅

### 3.1 Build Process

**Test Results:**
- ✅ `npm run build` completes successfully
- ✅ No TypeScript errors
- ✅ No Tailwind purge issues
- ✅ All assets generated correctly
- ✅ Bundle size: 572.11 kB (gzipped: 173.41 kB)

**Build Output:**
```
dist/index.html                   0.63 kB │ gzip:   0.37 kB
dist/assets/index-C2EyXUC2.css   24.38 kB │ gzip:   4.89 kB
dist/assets/index-DVd8w15O.js   572.11 kB │ gzip: 173.41 kB
```

### 3.2 Vercel Environment Variables

**Required Environment Variables:**
- `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`: https://xzdnruzcaoxmmaxkjtsl.supabase.co
- `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`: [Current anon key in supabase.ts]

**Note**: Currently hardcoded in `src/lib/supabase.ts` - should be moved to environment variables for production.

## 4. Code Quality Assessment

### 4.1 TypeScript
- ✅ All TypeScript errors resolved
- ✅ Proper type definitions for all components
- ✅ Null safety implemented with optional chaining

### 4.2 Error Handling
- ✅ Optimistic updates with rollback
- ✅ Toast notifications for user feedback
- ✅ Proper error boundaries and try-catch blocks

### 4.3 Performance
- ✅ Debounced search (300ms)
- ✅ Efficient re-renders with proper state management
- ✅ Lazy loading of AI enrichment

## 5. Post-Deploy Smoke Test Plan

**Test Sequence:**
1. **Add Bottle**: Add a new wine with minimal required fields
2. **AI Suggestions**: Wait for AI enrichment and verify suggestions appear
3. **Apply Suggestions**: Apply AI suggestions and verify data updates
4. **Mark Drunk**: Mark a wine as drunk and verify status change
5. **Search/Filter**: Test search and filter functionality
6. **Accessibility**: Test keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility

## 6. Recommendations

### 6.1 Environment Variables
- Move Supabase credentials to environment variables
- Use `VITE_SUPABASE_URL` and `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### 6.2 Bundle Size Optimization
- Consider code splitting for large bundle size (572KB)
- Implement dynamic imports for non-critical components

### 6.3 Error Monitoring
- Add error tracking service (Sentry, etc.)
- Implement proper logging for production
